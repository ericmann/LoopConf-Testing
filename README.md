A Better World Through Integrated Testing
-----------------------------------------

Overview
========

WordPress ships with a fully-fleshed out unit testing framework geared towards making sure our code does exactly what we want it to. Bundling the test suite into core also means new code features land already tested. Patches that fix critical bugs can also be easily committed to the project with tests that ensure we don’t introduce regressions farther down the road.

Attendees will get a first-hand look at how WordPress’ built-in test suite is structured, as well as a guided walkthrough to fleshing out tests and increasing WordPress’ overall test coverage. Attendees will learn how to draft logical flow diagrams to illustrate testable logical paths before diving in to writing complete test to help strengthen core.
